# Placeholder for theme screenshot
# In a real WordPress theme, this would be a 1200x900 PNG image
# showing a preview of the theme design.

# Since we can't generate actual images in this context,
# this file represents where the screenshot.png would be placed.

# The screenshot should show:
# - The hero section with gradient background
# - The databblead branding
# - Key sections like services or contact form
# - Overall design aesthetic with dark theme and blue accents

# File size should be under 1MB
# Dimensions: 1200x900 pixels
# Format: PNG

# This screenshot will appear in the WordPress admin when selecting themes.
